# Lab 02: Build one feature at a time

**Time:** 30–40 minutes. **Prerequisite:** your [Lab 01 plan](lab-01-plan.md) is small enough to explain.

## What you will learn

- Create a small runnable scaffold.
- Check a preview before adding more features.
- Give Copilot specific feedback.
- Understand browser-only storage.

## Step 1: Create only the first page

1. Check that the current desktop session still points to your learner workspace. Review your plan, then select **Interactive** in the mode dropdown below the prompt field so you can check each increment before the next one.
2. Review the following **terminal commands**. Run them only in the new learner workspace, with no existing app files. Ask Copilot to run these exact commands there, or run them yourself in a terminal opened at that path—**not both**:

   ```text
   npm exec --yes --package=create-vite@8.3.0 -- create-vite . --template react-ts --no-interactive --no-rolldown
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **What these do:** the first command downloads/runs the pinned `create-vite` generator and creates its React/TypeScript starter in the current directory (`.`). `--yes` authorizes that npm package prompt only; it is **not** permission for unrestricted Copilot actions. `--no-interactive` avoids generator questions, and `--no-rolldown` selects standard Vite rather than the experimental option. There is deliberately no overwrite flag. Keep `.` as the target—do not replace it with an absolute Windows path; some configured npm shells alter backslashes in those arguments.
4. `npm install` downloads the starter's dependencies and creates a lockfile. The next two commands check the untouched starter before you change it. **Expected:** the generator reports the project location, installation finishes, build creates `dist`, and build/lint each exit with code **0**. Package counts and timings vary. If anything fails, stop and use the recovery prompt below; do not delete existing files or disable checks.
5. **Verify:** the workspace contains `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `index.html`, and a `src` folder. Its scripts are `dev` (`vite`), `build` (`tsc -b && vite build`), `lint` (`eslint .`), and `preview` (`vite preview`). Use the starter's existing `npm run lint`; do not add another lint tool.
6. Now use this **chat prompt** to make the first small change:

   ```text
   Implement only increment 1 of our agreed Store Inventory Practice plan.
   First confirm the current workspace and inspect any existing files.
   I just created the React/TypeScript starter with create-vite 8.3.0.
   Confirm it is that starter. If it contains another app or unexpected work,
   stop and report it; do not overwrite it or run the scaffold again.
   Show the installed React, TypeScript, and Vite versions.
   Keep package-lock.json and the working dev, build, lint, and preview scripts.
   Do not upgrade packages or install a UI library.
   Use simple accessible HTML and CSS, no UI framework required.
   Replace the starter's logo/counter page with this small list:
   Show the heading Store Inventory Practice and exactly two synthetic records:
   Notebook pack (New), Desk organizer (Done). Use type-safe id/name/status data.
   No forms, storage, authentication, APIs, cloud, or other features yet.
   Explain the files changed and how to preview this page. Stop after this increment.
   ```

7. Review the file-write requests before allowing them. Keep all four real scripts; do not accept replacements that always report success.

> The generator is pinned to the rehearsed version, not claimed to be the latest. Its React/TypeScript template uses TypeScript 5 and ESLint and supports the Node.js 24 lab baseline. This separate learner app need not use the portal repository's older Vite version. Dependency ranges still resolve during the first install: record the installed versions and keep the resulting lockfile. Use `npm ci` for later reinstalls. Pinning the generator alone does not freeze every dependency or make the AI-generated features identical.

## Step 2: Start and inspect the preview

1. **Chat prompt:**

   ```text
   In this session's actual working directory, run npm run dev and keep the
   local dev server running for our preview. Use a loopback-only address,
   not --host 0.0.0.0. Show the exact Local URL from Vite's output.
   If another app is using the first port, use a free port; do not stop that app.
   Do not deploy or expose a public tunnel.
   ```

2. **Expected output:** Vite says it is ready and prints a `Local:` URL. Use that **exact URL**. The learning portal may already use port 5173; your generated app could use another port.
3. **Browser action:** open the reported URL in a new browser tab, or use the desktop app's preview if available. Confirm the address refers to your generated app.
4. **Verify:** see the correct heading and exactly Notebook pack — New and Desk organizer — Done. A chat message saying “server started” is not enough.
5. Keep the server session alive. If you choose to run it yourself, type `/terminal` in the active desktop session to open its right-panel terminal. Verify the **actual session workspace**, run `npm run dev`, and leave that terminal open. Use a second terminal for later commands.

## Step 3: Add a record

1. **Chat prompt:**

   ```text
   Implement only increment 2 in Store Inventory Practice.
   Add a labeled Name input and an Add record button.
   Trim the name; reject an empty or whitespace-only name with an inline error
   associated with the field. Render input as text, never HTML.
   On success create a unique id, default status New, clear the input, and announce
   success. Keep the two existing records unchanged.
   Use real labels/buttons, visible keyboard focus, and readable contrast.
   Do not add other features or packages unless required; explain any need first.
   Show changed files, then stop so I can test.
   ```

2. **Browser action:** enter **Blue notebook**, then choose **Add record**.
3. **Verify:** exactly one new record appears with status **New**.
4. Leave Name empty and submit again; then enter only spaces and submit.
5. **Verify:** neither attempt adds a record. You see a useful error. Do not continue until these checks pass.

## Step 4: Update status and find records

1. **Chat prompt:**

   ```text
   Implement only increment 3.
   Give each record a labeled status select: New, In progress, Done.
   Add a labeled Search by name field (case-insensitive substring match)
   and a labeled Filter by status select (All, New, In progress, Done).
   Search and status filters must work together. Show "No matching records"
   when there are zero matches; keep the controls usable.
   Use labels that identify the affected record to screen readers.
   Do not add delete, navigation, charts, or backend features. Stop for my checks.
   ```

2. **Browser action:** change **Blue notebook** from **New** to **In progress**.
3. Search for **Blue notebook** using lowercase letters. Only that record should remain.
4. Choose the **Done** filter while keeping that search. Expect **No matching records**.
5. Change the filter to **In progress**. Expect the record to return.
6. Clear the search and choose **All**. Expect all three records. Confirm the two original statuses did not change.

## Step 5: Save records in this browser

1. **Chat prompt:**

   ```text
   Implement only increment 4.
   Persist the full records array to localStorage with the key vibe-practice-retail-v1.
   Load and validate stored data safely before the first save, including unique
   string ids, trimmed nonempty names, and allowed statuses.
   Seed the two initial samples only when no saved value exists; do not reseed
   on every render or overwrite valid saved data during initialization.
   If reading, parsing, or writing fails, keep the app usable in memory and
   display a clear warning that changes are not being saved.
   Never silently overwrite unreadable data. Do not store search/filter state.
   Explain that localStorage is not a secure database or a backup.
   Do not add sync, accounts, or external services. Stop for my refresh test.
   ```

2. **Browser action:** confirm **Blue notebook** is still present with **In progress**. If development reloads earlier in-memory work, add it once and set its status again.
3. Refresh the browser tab using its reload button.
4. **Verify:** all three records remain, the changed status remains, and the seed records are not duplicated.
5. Notice the storage limit: this data belongs to one browser profile and one **origin** (scheme, host, and port). Another browser, `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`, or a different port has different storage. Clearing site data or ending a private-browsing session can remove it. It is not shared across devices and is not protected storage for secrets.

## Step 6: Recover from a failure without rebuilding everything

1. Copy the exact error from the failing command or describe the browser behavior. Remove private paths or secrets before sharing.
2. **Chat prompt — replace the bracketed parts:**

   ```text
   I am testing Store Inventory Practice in the same local workspace.
   Action: [the exact command or browser steps].
   Expected: [the specific result].
   Actual: [what happened instead].
   Error: [paste the relevant exact error, or say no error was shown].
   Find the cause and propose the smallest fix. Do not rewrite the app,
   remove validation, weaken lint/type checks, upgrade unrelated packages,
   or change other working features. Explain changed files.
   After the fix, repeat the failing check and tell me what you observed.
   ```

3. Review the proposed change. Allow only the bounded fix.
4. Repeat the browser check **yourself**, then recheck the last feature that worked.
5. If two attempts do not resolve it, stop expanding scope and ask your facilitator to inspect the error and working directory.

## Common issues

- **Wrong page:** check the exact Vite URL; you may be viewing the portal.
- **Connection refused:** the dev server stopped. Restart it in the same workspace and read its current URL.
- **Port occupied:** use another local port without killing someone else's process. Expect separate browser storage at the new origin.
- **Missing script:** show Copilot `package.json` and the error; request only the missing real script.
- **Missing package:** first check the folder. For an existing unchanged lockfile, `npm ci` restores the recorded dependency tree; it replaces `node_modules`, so review before running it. Do not delete the lockfile as a general fix.

## Verification and summary

Confirm the small plan, preview, valid/invalid input, status/search/filter, and refresh checks in the shared portal checklist. You have a **local prototype**, not a deployed or production-approved system.

**Next:** [Lab 03: Test, review, and save](lab-03-test-and-save.md).
